## As easy as 1, 2, 3

### 1. Get de IDE

[Download and install](/getting-started/download) the Pinguino IDE in your computer. Don't known 
how to use it? Check the [Pinguino IDE v13 user manual](/pinguino-ide-v13).

### 2. Write and compile

```processing
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {

  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {

  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```

Pinguino boards are programmed using the [Pinguino language](/language-reference), that in turn,
is based on Wiring and Processing Languages.

### 3. Upload

Connect the board to your PC and upload the code. Enjoy!
