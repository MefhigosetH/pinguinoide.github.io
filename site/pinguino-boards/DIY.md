Pinguino Project is [Open Hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware). This means
that the user has access to all the necessary technical information that allows him to
design and / or build his own Pinguino board.

Even more: The design of Pinguino is so simple that the boards can be built in breadboard,
perforated plates, or single-faced Pertinax, at home. And if you have the resources, you can send
the Gerber files to suppliers like [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) or [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
for a professional finish, at U$D 2-5 for 5 pieces.

## How to build a board ?

Follow these simple steps:

1. **Board design**
  * Design the board yourself. You can find basic diagrams on the [8-bit supported boards](/pinguino-boards/supported-boards-8) page.
  * Or choice one of the following diagrams bellow.

2. **Board manufacturing**
  * Make the board yourself.
  * Or send the Gerber files to a manufacturer.

3. **Board firmware**
  * Burn the Pinguino firmware on the chip.
  * Or buy a microcontroller with the firmware already inside.

4. Enjoy
