## 18F2550

Ideal for low power (nanoWatt) and connectivity applications that benefit from the availability
of three serial ports: FS-USB (12 Mbit/s), I²C™ and SPI™ (up to 10Mbit/s) and an asynchronous
(LIN capable) serial port (EUSART).

Large amounts of RAM memory for buffering and Enhanced FLASH
program memory make it ideal for embedded control and monitoring applications that require periodic
connection with a (legacy free) Personal Computer via USB for data upload/download and/or
firmware updates.
